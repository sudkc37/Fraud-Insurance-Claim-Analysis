For data analysis, Structured Query Language (SQL) was employed, and Python's Plotly and Seaborn libraries were used to create interactive charts and plots. 
Findings provide significant insights into the distribution of insurance types, the prevalence of fraud claims, and their geographical concentration. 
The analysis revealed that approximately 55% of the insurance policies examined are life insurance policies. Interestingly, about 18% of total fraud claims
are related to mobile insurance, even though mobile insurance accounts for only 0.41% of the total insurance policies.
